PrimeFactorization README

This program is straight-forward. You enter a number and the program will spit
out the prime factorization for that number.

Setting this thing up is a little tricky though.

The program relies on a text file that includes a list of prime numbers all the way
up to 100k. (I could have done without it, but it runs much faster this way)
You need to copy and paste the file path into the program when it asks you. If
it is not entered correctly, the program will immediately close.

The easiest way to do this is to right click the "primes-to-100k" file and click
"Properties" at the bottom of the pop-up menu. Under the "General" tab, it should
list the file path. Just copy and paste that into the program when it asks for it,
and it should go.

Double click the "PrimeFactorization" shortcut and enjoy!
